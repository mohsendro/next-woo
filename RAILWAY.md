# Deploy and Host next-woo on Railway

next-woo is a headless WooCommerce storefront built with Next.js 16, React 19, and TypeScript. It features product browsing, cart, checkout (via WooCommerce), and blog support. Includes a pre-configured WordPress container with WooCommerce and cache revalidation plugin.

## About Hosting next-woo

This template deploys a complete headless WooCommerce stack: a MySQL database, WordPress with WooCommerce, and Next.js frontend. WordPress and WooCommerce handle products, orders, and payments while Next.js delivers a fast, modern storefront. The included revalidation plugin automatically invalidates the Next.js cache when products or content change, ensuring your store always shows fresh data. Environment variables are pre-configured to connect all three services securely.

## Common Use Cases

- E-commerce stores wanting modern performance with WordPress's familiar admin
- Agencies building custom storefronts for clients who manage their own products
- Existing WooCommerce stores migrating to a headless frontend
- Stores requiring custom checkout flows or unique frontend experiences

## Dependencies for next-woo Hosting

- MySQL 8.0+ (included in template)
- WordPress 6.x with WooCommerce 8.x (included in template)

### Deployment Dependencies

### Implementation Details

After deployment, WordPress auto-installs with WooCommerce and the revalidation plugin pre-configured.

**Post-Deployment Setup:**

1. Wait for WordPress to finish initializing (first deploy takes a few minutes)
2. Visit your WordPress admin at `https://your-wordpress-domain/wp-admin`
3. Log in with credentials from your environment variables:
   ```
   WORDPRESS_ADMIN_USER=admin
   WORDPRESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
   WORDPRESS_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
   ```
4. Go to **WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced → REST API**
5. Generate API keys with **Read/Write** permissions
6. Update your Next.js service environment variables with the real keys:
   ```
   WC_CONSUMER_KEY=ck_xxxxx
   WC_CONSUMER_SECRET=cs_xxxxx
   ```
7. Redeploy the Next.js service to pick up the new keys

To persist uploads and product images between deploys, Pro plan users can add a volume at `/var/www/html/wp-content`.
